# Roadmap

This file provides an overview of the direction this project is heading.

Even if I no longer have the luck of working on Sniffnet full-time (as described in [#329](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/discussions/329)),
I'll try all my best to make the application grow even further by targeting the following features, improvements, and fixes. <br>

Sections are sorted by relevance. <br>
Elements inside a section are sorted by expected release date. <br>
Known open problems are reported at the bottom of this file.
